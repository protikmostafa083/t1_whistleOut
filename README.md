## About the Project

This is a collaborative project by the team from the University of Technology Sydney's (UTS) Master of Data Science and Innovation (MDSI) program. This initiative is a significant contribution stemming from our participation in the iLAB2 subject.

### Project Overview

Our project focuses on the development and enhancement of WhistleOut, a prominent comparison website that assists consumers in making informed decisions about mobile phones and internet plans. In addition, the platform covers comparisons of fixed-line broadband plans, wireless broadband plans, 5G plans, consumer products, and subscription TV service offerings. As a team of four driven individuals, we have pooled our expertise, skills, and enthusiasm to tackle this challenge head-on. With the guidance of our instructors and mentors, we are committed to delivering a robust solution that aligns with the vision and values of WhistleOut.
